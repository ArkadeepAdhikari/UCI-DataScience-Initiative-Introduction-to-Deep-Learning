# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning
# Description
This repo contains the codes for the workshop <b>Introduction to Deep learning</b> as a part of <b>UCI Data Science Initiative.</b>
In this workshop the basic ideas of neural networks and Tensorflow programming fundamentals were dealt with through building and 
training different machine learning models. Also more advanced applications of deep learning in computer vision were discussed as well.

# Requirements
Python3 along with Tensorflow and Keras API have been used for the codes in this repository
